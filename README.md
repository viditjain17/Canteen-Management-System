## Technologies Used

- Frontend UI: The user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to provide an intuitive and visually appealing experience for the users.

- Backend Architecture: The backend of the system is developed using Node.js and the Express.js framework. This allows for efficient handling of requests and seamless communication between the frontend and the backend.

- Database Integration: MongoDB is used as the backend database to store and retrieve canteen-related data such as menus, inventory, and transactions. This ensures efficient data management and retrieval.

- User Authentication and Authorization: The system implements user authentication and authorization mechanisms using MD5 encryption to ensure secure access to the system's features. This helps in protecting user information and maintaining the privacy of the system.
